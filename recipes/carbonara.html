    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h3>Prep Ingredients:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut Guanciale into thin strips, with meat in middle and fat atop.</li>
        <li>Grate the Pecorino Romano as small as you can</li>
        <li>Seperate yolk(s) from whites and put into bowl. (Do with whites as you will)</li>
        <li>Add the 1 whole egg into bowl.</li>
        <li>Add generous amount of Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Beat with fork</li>
        <li>Start gradually mixing in the Pecorino and set aside</li>
    </ol> 
    <h3>Cooking the meal:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the Guanciale into a cold pan and put heat to medium-low and slowly render out the fat.</li>
        <li>Once the Guanciale is cooked, put aside leaving the rendered fat in the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook your pasta, just before finishing remove at least one mug full of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Place the Pasta into the pan and mix until the pasta absorbs all the oil (make sure you reheated pan slightly before this).</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of guanciale to the pasta.</li>
        <li>Pour a tiny amount of pasta water, just to cover the bottom into the pan.</li>
        <li>Bring the water you cooked the pasta back to a boil and place the pan with pasta atop of it.</li>
        <li>Add your egg mix and immediately start stirring.</li>
        <li>Add pasta water depending on whether or not you can toss the pasta in the pan.</li>
        <li>Plate and serve immediately with the rest of the Guanciale ontop, some more grated Pecorino and another drizzle of black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
